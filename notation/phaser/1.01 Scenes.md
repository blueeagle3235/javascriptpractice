# Phaser Scenes

Phaser has many game objects, but arguably one of the most important are scenes. Scenes allow a way to switch almost everything, from literal scenes, to backdrops, to menu switching, all of it can be done with scenes. To initialize a scene follow the code below:
```js
class whateverscenenameyouputinehere extends Phaser.Scene{


}
```
Once you have initialized the scene, you should put in a constructor.

```js
class whateverscenenameyouputinehere extends Phaser.Scene{
    constructor(){
        super({ key: 'whateverscenenameyouputinhere' });
    }

}
```
Actually, scenes are actually not much different from games. Scenes have the three functions, preload, create and update, so you could put your game into scenes.
```js
class whateverscenenameyouputinehere extends Phaser.Scene{
    constructor(){
        super({ key: 'whateverscenenameyouputinhere' });
    }
    preload(){
        this.load.image('tempimg','assets/tempimage.jpg');//remember me? i'm back :D
    }
    create(){
        this.add.image(300,400,'tempimg');
    }
    update(){
        console.log('you are being spammed');
    }
}
```
If you import your game code into a scene, say you create a new scene, you might not know how to actually run it. How you run it can be used in many different ways, but these 2 are the most common:
```js
this.scenes.start('whateverscenenameyouputinhere');
//warning, you usually should stop the scene before running it, if not can lead to multiple instances of the scene running
```
Second one below, this one uses the config file to declare the order of the scenes:
```js
var config = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    scene:[ scene1,scene2,scene3 ]
};
```
You can easily swap scenes using the scene.start function, and the best part is you can pretty much have as many as you want. In that case, you do not need a seperate js file for your coding, as you can just scene.start your menu, seperate game, whatever your imagination would like to add into code.

Scenes are pretty basic to cover(i dont know if i covered everything) but if you want more game objects be sure to read on.
