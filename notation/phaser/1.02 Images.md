# Images

In this documentation, we will explain what images are and how you put them in your application.

You should already know what an image is, if not you can search it up.

To import an image, you need to put the image in a referenceable folder, for example a assets folder. You will need to then go into your preload function and enter in
```js
this.load.image('imagenameincode','assets/image.jpg');
                //image name        image reference, to folder and jpg file
```

And when you would like to add your image enter this in your create function:
```js
this.add.image(400,300,'imagenameincode');
            // x   y    reference to preload function
```
You can call this.add.image nearly anywhere, just if you put it in your update function it will generate many copies and cause unnessecary lag (unless you are trying to do so)
